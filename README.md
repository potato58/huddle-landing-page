## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I found working with svg icons for the social media links challenging (specifically, changing the colour of the icons), as this was my first time working with svg in css/html. 

### Continued development

I used this challenge to practise responsive design using flexbox, and to practise using custom css properties. 

In future projects I want to practise:
  - background images (sizing)
  - working with svg
  - css custom properties
  - accessibility

### Useful resources
